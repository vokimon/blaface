# Blaface

This is a proof of concept of a web app animating svg files
interactively.

The skeleton is based on [mortar](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar/).



# Mortar Usage

There are a few ways to get this template:

* git clone git://github.com/mozilla/mortar-app-stub.git myapp
* volo create myapp mozilla/mortar-app-stub

If you have node installed, you can run a development server with volo:

* cd myapp
* volo serve

View the app at http://localhost:8008/.
